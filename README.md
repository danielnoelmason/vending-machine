# Vending Machine Project

This project was developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming module. It is written in Java and the `Menu.java` file serves as the executable.

## Description

The Vending Machine project is a simulation of a vending machine with various functionalities, including stock management, change calculations, and a console-based user interface for vending.

## Features

- Stock management: The vending machine keeps track of available items and their quantities.
- Change calculations: The machine calculates the change to be given based on the amount inserted and the item's price.
- Console UI: Users can interact with the vending machine through a simple console-based interface.
